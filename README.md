# Library Management System

## Overview

The Library Management System is a C++ program designed to simulate a library management system. It includes features to add books, display book details, check out and return books, and maintain a record of library patrons. The program utilizes object-oriented programming principles with classes and data structures like linked lists or vectors to manage library operations efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Books:** Allows librarians to add new books to the library's collection.
- **Display Book Details:** Provides information about books including title, author, and availability.
- **Check-Out Books:** Enables patrons to borrow books from the library.
- **Return Books:** Allows patrons to return borrowed books.
- **Manage Patrons:** Maintains records of library patrons, including their details and borrowed books.

## Implementation Details

### Classes and Data Structures

- **Book Class:** Represents a book with attributes such as ID, title, author, and availability status.
- **Patron Class:** Represents a library patron with attributes like ID, name, and a list of borrowed books.
- **Library Class:** Manages the collection of books and patrons. Includes methods to add books, manage book availability, and handle patron transactions.

### Data Storage

- Utilizes data structures like vectors or linked lists to store and manage collections of books and patrons efficiently.
- Implements algorithms for searching, sorting, and retrieving information about books and patrons.
